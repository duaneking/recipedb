An Open Source Recipe Collection and Standardization Experiment Project

# Preamble.
It is my firm belief that most recipe websites online are completely broken and Maliciously harmful to the average person.

My personal experience has been that they actively do what they can to harm the person who is just looking looking for recipes so they can eat, by wasting their time and actively serving up malicious malware and targeting advertisements designed to track and exploit people in wasys that harm them.

As a Principle Software Developer, I am so sick of looking for recipes and then finding that my ad blocker is going insane because it's trying to protect me from all the threats that the average housewife doesn't even know exists online. Worse, I recognize that there's a lot of people that could be helped with this, because they're being exploited by marketers who simply don't care about their desire to feed their family and get on with their day.

The goal of this project is to:

1. Standardize Recipe Formats in an open source way. This means standardizing ingredients lists, as well as cooking operations. While many of these standards already exist in cooking the current free market actively works to keep them as separate and nonstandardized as possible via these cooking blog sites, in order to assure that the differences in the presentation of the recipe can be exploited and so its as difficult as possible for the person looking for the recipe to actially get the recipe data they need simply and fast, because they want to waste your time, increase engamement, and track and spy on you. I wish to stop that, by first increasing standardization - and Interoptability - and then provding a central free recipe collection that is not only open source, but provides different cultures and peoples a way to standardize and save their cultural knowledge of cooking and share it with the rest of the world in the form of good meals that can be eaten with friends and family.

2. Create and provide an open source and public recipe collection leveraging this open source  work. As things are standardized and the recipe collection grows, I expect it to actively become its own cooking community.

3. Provide explicitly non-profit open source libraries and code to standardize and process these standards so that individuals are not held hostage to these kind of abusive and expliotive websites.

# A note on formats
Multiple formats for recipes exist. One goal of this project is to standardize recipe and operation formats.

# Project Status: Ongoing, 
This project exists because I wanted to get it out of my head and on to github so I can think about it later. It is not my current priority, but it will get worked on as I get hungry and need to cook and then decide to throw a few lines of code at this while I eat and think about what I cooked.

# First Step
If you have good recipes you want to contribute, that we can leverage to figure out the correct formatting and standardization, That would be extremely helpful. Very complicated recipes would work the best, because they would introduce the most test cases. But as somebody who does not cook or bake much themselves, I'm also fully aware that I'm going to learn a lot from this. And that's kind of the goal, as well.

So I think what I'm going to do is probably take a weekend and bake something, and then see how the recipe can be translated to a standardized model, and then just start from there. Iterating as the needed to figure things out. I dont expect this to take up much of my time, and I expect to come back to this as time allows.

# First Goal - v0
- A single recipe in a standardized format.

# Second Goal - v0.1 
- A single bread baking recipe in a standardized format.
- A single uncooked recipe in a standardized format.
- A stovetop skillet recipe in a standardized format.
- A stovetop soucepan recipe in a standardized format.

# Third -v 0.2
- A weeks worth of different meals as recipes in a standardized format.
